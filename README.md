Simply Weather was an application I decided to build to learn the basics of React Hooks and to work with more 3rd Party API's. The project initially took about a week or two to build but I have recently been learning more UX/UI concepts that I wanted to try to update the projects look and feel. Some Interesting things Ive tackled in this project is trying to make two API play nice with each other and handle potentially missing data from the data model from the API's. I also learned about Geolocation and how to implement the best posible design choices to make is less cumbersome for users. This Project is important to me because I used to work with React Class components exclusivley because thats what was taught to me in at Devmountains coding bootcamp. I used to not like the idea of hooks, but I love them now even though they have a lot of gottcha's haha. Im still trying to learn more and advance my knowledge on design and believe this project is a good project to try new things.
